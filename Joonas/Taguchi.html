<h1>INTRODUCTION TO TAGUCHI METHOD</h1>
<h2>1. Background</h2>
<p>The technique of laying out the conditions of experiments involving
multiple factors was first proposed by the Englishman, Sir R.A.Fisher.
The method is popularly known as the factorial design of experiments. A
full factorial design will identify all possible combinations for a
given set of factors. Since most industrial experiments usually involve
a significant number of factors, a full factorial design results in a
large number of experiments. To reduce the number of experiments to a
practical level, only a small set from all the possibilities is
selected. The method of selecting a limited number of experiments which
produces the most information is known as a partial fraction
experiment. Although this method is well known, there are no general
guidelines for its application or the analysis of the results obtained
by performing the experiments. Taguchi constructed a special set of
general design guidelines for factorial experiments that cover many
applications. </p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Basic concepts</h2>
<h3>2.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Taguchi has envisaged a clever method of conducting the design of
experiments, which is based on well defined guidelines. This method
uses a special set of arrays called orthogonal arrays. These standard
arrays stipulate the way of conducting the minimal number of
experiments, which could give the full information of all the factors
that affect the performance parameter. The crux of the orthogonal
arrays method lies in choosing the level combinations of the input
design variables for each experiment. </p>
<h3>2.2 A Typical Orthogonal Array</h3>
<p>While there are many standard orthogonal arrays available, each of
the arrays is meant for a specific number of independent design
variables and levels. For example, if one wants to conduct an
experiment to understand the influence of 4 different independent
variables with each variable having 3 set values (level values), then
an L9 orthogonal array might be the right choice. The L9 orthogonal
array is meant for understanding the effect of 4 independent factors
each having 3 factor level values. This array assumes that there is no
interaction between any two factors. While in many cases, no
interaction model assumption is valid, there are some cases where there
is a clear evidence of interaction. A typical case of interaction would
be the interaction between the material properties and temperature. </p>

<p>Table 2.1 Layout of L9 orthogonal array.</p>
<p>The Table 2.1 shows an L9 orthogonal array. There are in total 9
experiments to be conducted and each experiment is based on the
combination of level values as shown in the table. For example, the
third experiment is conducted by keeping the independent design
variable 1 at level 1, variable 2 at level 3, variable 3 at level 3,
and variable 4 at level 3.</p>
<h3>2.3 Properties of an orthogonal array</h3>
<p>The orthogonal arrays have the following special properties that
reduce the number of experiments to be conducted.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The vertical column under each independent variable of the above
table has a special combination of level settings. All the level
settings appear an equal number of times. For L9 array under variable
4, level 1 , level 2 and level 3 appears thrice. This is called the
balancing property of orthogonal arrays.</li>
  <li>All the level values of independent variables are used for
conducting
the experiments.</li>
  <li>The sequence of level values for conducting the experiments shall
not
be changed. This means one can not conduct experiment 1 with variable
1, level 2 setup and experiment 4 with variable 1 , level 1 setup. The
reason for this is that the array of each factor columns are mutually
orthogonal to any other column of level values. The inner product of
vectors corresponding to weights is zero. If the above 3 levels are
normalized between -1 and 1, then the weighing factors for level 1,
level 2 , level 3 are -1 , 0 , 1 respectively. </li>
</ol>
<h3>2.4 Minimum number of experiments to be conducted</h3>
<p>The design of experiments using the orthogonal array is, in most
cases, efficient when compared to many other statistical designs. The
minimum number of experiments that are required to conduct the Taguchi
method can be calculated based on the degrees of freedom approach.
<img style="width: 516px; height: 152px;" src="/Users/joonasrehand/GitHub/web-tutorial/Joonas/experiments3.gif"></p>
<p>For example, in case of 8 independent variables study having 1
independent variable with 2 levels and remaining 7 independent
variables with 3 levels ( L18 orthogonal array) , the minimum number of
experiments required is 16. Because of the balancing property of the
orthogonal arrays, the total number of experiments shall be multiple of
2 and 3. Hence the number of experiments for the above case is 18.
</p>
<h3>2.5 Assumptions of the Taguchi method</h3>
<p>The additive assumption implies that the individual or main effects
of the independent variables on performance parameter are separable.
Under this assumption, the effect of each factor can be linear,
quadratic or of higher order, but the model assumes that there exists
no cross product effects (interactions) among the individual factors.
That means the effect of independent variable 1 on performance
parameter does not depend on the different level settings of any other
independent variables and vice versa. If at anytime, this assumption is
violated, then the additivity of the main effects does not hold, and
the variables interact.
