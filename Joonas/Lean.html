<h1>DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS</h1>
<h2>Design Steps </h2>
<p>The design of an experiment involves the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Selection of independent variables</li>
  <li>Selection of number of level settings for each independent
variable</li>
  <li>Selection of orthogonal array </li>
  <li>Assigning the independent variables to each column </li>
  <li>Conducting the experiments </li>
  <li>Analyzing the data </li>
  <li>Inference </li>
</ol>
<p>The details of the above steps are given below.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Selection of the independent variables</h2>
<p>Before conducting the experiment, the knowledge of the
product/process under investigation is of prime importance for
identifying the factors likely to influence the outcome. In order to
compile a comprehensive list of factors, the input to the experiment is
generally obtained from all the people involved in the project. </p>
<h2>2. Deciding the number of levels</h2>
<p> Once the independent variables are decided, the number of levels
for each variable is decided. The selection of number of levels depends
on how the performance parameter is affected due to different level
settings. If the performance parameter is a linear function of the
independent variable, then the number of level setting shall be 2.
However, if the independent variable is not linearly related, then one
could go for 3, 4 or higher levels depending on whether the
relationship is quadratic, cubic or higher order. In the absence of
exact nature of relationship between the independent variable and the
performance parameter, one could choose 2 level settings. After
analyzing the experimental data, one can decide whether the assumption
of level setting is right or not based on the percent contribution and
the error calculations.
</p>
<h2>3. Selection of an orthogonal array</h2>
<p> Before selecting the orthogonal array, the minimum number of
experiments to be conducted shall be fixed based on the total number of
degrees of freedom present in the study. The minimum number of
experiments that must be run to study the factors shall be more than
the total degrees of freedom available. In counting the total degrees
of freedom the investigator commits 1 degree of freedom to the overall
mean of the response under study. The number of degrees of freedom
associated with each factor under study equals one less than the number
of levels available for that factor. Hence the total degrees of freedom
without interaction effect is 1+ as given by equation 2.1. For example,
in
case of 11 independent variables, each having 2 levels, the
total degrees of freedom is 12. Hence the selected orthogonal array
shall have at least 12 experiments. An L12 orthogonal satisfies this
requirement. Once the minimum number of experiments is decided, the
further selection of orthogonal array is based on the number of
independent variables and number of factor levels for each independent
variable.

<h2>4. Assigning the independent variables to columns</h2>
<p> The order in which the independent variables are assigned to the
vertical column is very essential. In case of mixed level variables and
interaction between variables, the variables are to be assigned at
right columns as stipulated by the orthogonal array.
Finally, before conducting the experiment, the actual level values of
each design variable shall be decided. It shall be noted that the
significance and the percent contribution of the independent variables
changes depending on the level values assigned. It is the designers
responsibility to set proper level values.
</p>
<h2>5. Conducting the experiment</h2>
<p> Once the orthogonal array is selected, the experiments are
conducted as per the level combinations. It is necessary that all the
experiments be conducted. The interaction columns and dummy variable
columns shall not be considered for conducting the experiment, but are
needed while analyzing the data to understand the interaction effect.
The performance parameter under study is noted down for each experiment
to conduct the sensitivity analysis.
</p>
<h2>6. Analysis of the data </h2>
<p> Since each experiment is the combination of different factor
levels, it is essential to segregate the individual effect of
independent variables. This can be done by summing up the performance
parameter values for the corresponding level settings. For example, in
order to find out the main effect of level 1 setting of the independent
variable 2 (“Introduction to Taguchi Method” Table 2.1), sum the
performance parameter values of the experiments 1, 4 and 7. Similarly
for level 2, sum the experimental results of 2, 5 and 7 and so on. Once
the mean value of each level of a particular independent variable is
calculated, the sum of square of deviation of each of the mean value
from the grand mean value is calculated. This sum of square deviation
of a particular variable indicates whether the performance parameter is
sensitive to the change in level setting. If the sum of square
deviation is close to zero or insignificant, one may conclude that the
design variable is not influencing the performance of the process. In
other words, by conducting the sensitivity analysis, and performing
analysis of variance (ANOVA), one can decide which independent factor
dominates over other and the percentage contribution of that particular
independent variable. </p>
<h2>7. Inference </h2>
<p> From the above experimental analysis, it is clear that the higher
the value of sum of square of an independent variable, the more it has
influence on the performance parameter. One can also calculate the
ratio of individual sum of square of a particular independent variable
to the total sum of squares of all the variables. This ratio gives the
percent contribution of the independent variable on the performance
parameter. </p>
